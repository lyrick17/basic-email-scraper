# Email Scraper Clipboard
This is simple python program that will scrap emails from copied text in clipboard
and then will replace the copied text with lists of emails (one email per line).
Thus, after running the program, your copied text will become list of emails you can paste anywhere.

## Note:
- Make sure that you have copied the document where you want to scrap the emails
- Tip: use CTRL + A to copy all the text in a document, and then run the .py file, then you can paste the emails wherever you want.
- Make sure you have downloaded Python3 in your desktop
- Also, make sure you install pyperclip. To do that, go to command file and type this:
  `pip install pyperclip`

### More Updates
This program might soon be updated into a desktop app or a mobile app
