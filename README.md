# Email Scraper Clipboard
This is simple python program designed with PyQT6 GUI that will scrap emails from copied text in clipboard
and then will replace the copied text with lists of emails (one email per line).
Thus, after running the program, your copied text will become list of emails you can paste anywhere.

## Notes:
- Make sure that you have copied the document where you want to scrap the emails
- Click the Update Button to see the preview of current copied text, then click Scrap Email Button to perform the program
- The emails are automatically copied, but you can copy then again using Copy Results Button
- Reset the whole program by clicking Reset Button
- Tip: use CTRL + A to copy all the text in a document
- Make sure you have downloaded Python3 in your desktop
- Make sure you install pyperclip (for copying the text from clipboard). To do that, go to command file and type this:
  ```
  pip install pyperclip
  ```
- Make sure you install PyQT6 (for the GUI). Go to command file and type this:
  ```
  pip install pyqt6
  ```
